This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

npm run dev

## use packages
**react-hook-form**: A lightweight form library that reduces re-renders and simplifies form handling in React.
**zod**: A TypeScript-first schema validation library, useful for form validation and API validation.

## Bonus:
- Implement a "loading" indicator while the API request is in progress. 
- Use Next.js dynamic routes to allow sharing of profile URLs, e.g., /user/octocat.



Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
